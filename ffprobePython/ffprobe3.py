"""
A Python3 wrapper-library around the ``ffprobe`` command-line program.

(**Note:** This wrapper-library depends on the ``ffprobe`` command-line program
to extract metadata from media files or streams.  The ``ffprobe`` program must
be installed, with an ``ffprobe`` executable that can be found by searching the
``$PATH`` environment variable.)

This package is a fork (now actually a **complete rewrite**) of package
``ffprobe-python`` which was maintained by Mark Ma:

- https://pypi.org/project/ffprobe-python/
- https://github.com/gbstack/ffprobe-python

----

Changes and improvements in this fork:

Noteworthy improvements in this fork include:

- Fixed a few Python3 compatibility bugs in the pre-fork code.
- Re-wrote the ``ffprobe`` call to request & parse the ``json`` print-format.
- Handle "Chapter" in ffprobe output.  ("Stream" was already handled.)
- Support/allow remote media streams (as ``ffprobe`` program already does).
- Local-file-exists checks are optional (use ``verify_local_mediafile=False``).
- More classes, with more attributes & methods for commonly-accessed metadata.
- Get datasize as bytes (``1185288357``) or human-readable (``"1.2 GB"``).
- Get duration as seconds (``5751.787``) or human-readable (``"01:35:51.79"``).
- Get "avg frame-rate" as FPS (``29.97``) or ratio 2-tuple (``(2516481, 83966)``).
- Get "r frame-rate" as FPS (``29.97``) or ratio 2-tuple (``(2997, 100)``).
- All ffprobe-output classes wrap & retain their JSON data for introspection.
- All ffprobe-output classes can be reconstructed from their JSON ``repr()``.
- Added several derived exception classes for more-informative error reporting.
- Re-wrote the subprocess code to use convenient new Python3 library features.
- Documented the API (Sphinx/reST docstrings for modules, classes, methods).

These are the currently-implemented classes to wrap ffprobe JSON output:

- ``FFprobe(ParsedJson)``
- ``FFformat(ParsedJson)``
- ``FFchapter(ParsedJson)``
- ``FFstream(ParsedJson)``
- ``FFattachmentStream(FFstream)``
- ``FFaudioStream(FFstream)``
- ``FFsubtitleStream(FFstream)``
- ``FFvideoStream(FFstream)``

Significant API-breaking changes in this fork include:

- **Changed the client-facing API of functions & classes**.
- **No longer support Python 2 or Python3 < 3.3**.

Example usage::

    #!/usr/bin/env python3

    import ffprobe3

    # Function `ffprobe3.probe(media_filename)` is the entry point to this module;
    # it's the first function you want to call.

    # Local media file:
    ffprobe_output = ffprobe3.probe('media-file.mov')

    # ... or, a remote video stream:
    ffprobe_output = ffprobe3.probe('http://some-streaming-url.com:8080/stream')

    # Examine the metadata in `ffprobe_output` (of class `FFprobe`):

    # The "format" key in the parsed JSON becomes an `FFformat` instance:
    media_format = ffprobe_output.format

    # The size of the media in Bytes (if provided by `ffprobe`):
    if media_format.size_B is not None:
        print("media size = %d Bytes" % media_format.size_B)
    # ... or in human-readable base-10 prefix format (e.g., "567.8 MB"):
    if media_format.size_human is not None:
        print("media size = %s" % media_format.size_human)

    # The duration of the media:
    if media_format.duration_secs is not None:
        print("media duration = %f secs" % media_format.duration_secs)
    # ... or in human-readable "HH:MM:SS.ss" format (e.g., "01:04:14.80")
    if media_format.duration_human is not None:
        print("media duration = %s (HH:MM:SS.ss)" % media_format.duration_human)

    # Access a list of streams using `.streams`:
    print("media contains %d streams" % len(ffprobe_output.streams))

    # Access a list of chapters using `.chapters`:
    print("media contains %d chapters" % len(ffprobe_output.chapters))

    # Access specific stream types directly by named attribute of `FFprobe`:
    # In this new code version, each stream attribute of class `FFprobe` also
    # contains a list of instances of *only* a single specific derived class
    # of base class `FFstream`:
    # - `.attachment` -> `FFattachmentStream`
    # - `.audio` -> `FFaudioStream`
    # - `.subtitle` -> `FFsubtitleStream`
    # - `.video` -> `FFvideoStream`
    video_stream = ffprobe_output.video[0]  # assuming at least 1 video stream
    audio_stream = ffprobe_output.audio[0]  # assuming at least 1 audio stream

    # Derived class `FFvideoStream` has attributes `width` & `height` for
    # the frame dimensions in pixels (or `None` if not found in the JSON):
    video_width = video_stream.width
    video_height = video_stream.height
    if video_width is not None and video_height is not None:
        print("video frame shape = (%d, %d)" % (video_width, video_height))

    # Class `FFvideoStream` also has a method `.get_frame_shape()`,
    # which returns the frame (width, height) in pixels as a pair of ints
    # (or `None` if *either* dimension's value is not found in the JSON):
    video_frame_shape = video_stream.get_frame_shape()
    if video_frame_shape is not None:
        print("video frame shape = (%d, %d)" % video_frame_shape)

    # This `get_frame_shape()` is a method with a name that begins with `get_`
    # (rather than simply an attribute called `frame_shape`, for example) to
    # indicate that:
    #     (a) It has a "default" `default` of `None`
    #         (like Python's `dict.get(key, default=None)`).
    # and:
    #     (b) You may override this "default" `default` as a keyword argument
    #         (for example, if you would rather return a pair `(None, None)`
    #         than a single `None` value, for 2-tuple deconstruction).
    #
    # So you could instead use a 2-tuple deconstruction with a default `None`
    # for each element:
    (video_width, video_height) = video_stream.get_frame_shape((None, None))
    if video_width is not None and video_height is not None:
        print("video frame shape = (%d, %d)" % (video_width, video_height))

    # Derived class `FFaudioStream` has an attribute `.sample_rate_Hz`
    # (which defaults to `None` if no value was provided by `ffprobe`):
    if audio_stream.sample_rate_Hz is not None:
        print("audio sample rate = %d Hz" % audio_stream.sample_rate_Hz)

    # Not sure which attributes & methods are available for each class?
    # Every class has 3 introspection methods:
    # - method `.list_attr_names()`
    # - method `.list_getter_names()`
    # - method `.keys()`

    # Which attributes does this class offer?  Get a list of names:
    print(audio_stream.list_attr_names())

    # Which getter methods does this class offer?  Get a list of names:
    print(audio_stream.list_getter_names())

    # Which keys are in the original dictionary of parsed JSON for this class?
    print(audio_stream.keys())

**To see a comprehensive usage** of (almost all) the attributes, methods, and
exceptions in the `ffprobe3` class & function API, also look at test module
`tests/test_ffprobe3.py <https://github.com/jboy/ffprobe3-python3/blob/master/tests/test_ffprobe3.py>`_ (link into GitHub repo).

    """
    Wrap the ``ffprobe`` command, requesting the ``json`` print-format.
    Parse the JSON output into a hierarchy of :class:`ParsedJson` classes.

    **Note:** This function is the entry point to this module;
    it's the first function you want to call.  This function will return
    a valid, appropriately-populated instance of class :class:`FFprobe`
    (or raise some derived class of the exception base class
    :class:`ffprobe3.exceptions.FFprobeError` trying).

    Args:
        media_filename (str):
            filename of local media or URI of remote media to probe
        communicate_timeout (positive float, optional):
            a timeout in seconds for ``subprocess.Popen.communicate``
        ffprobe_cmd_override (str, optional):
            file-path of a command to invoke instead of default ``"ffprobe"``
        verify_local_mediafile (bool, optional):
            verify `media_filename` exists, if it's a local file (sanity check)

    Returns:
        a new instance of class :class:`FFprobe`

    Raises:
        FFprobeError: the base class of all exception classes in this package
        FFprobeExecutableError: ffprobe command not found in ``$PATH``
        FFprobeInvalidArgumentError: invalid value to `communicate_timeout`
        FFprobeJsonParseError: JSON parser was unable to parse ffprobe output
        FFprobeMediaFileError: specified local media file does not exist
        FFprobeOverrideFileError: `ffprobe_cmd_override` file not found
        FFprobePopenError: ``subprocess.Popen`` failed, raised an exception
        FFprobeSubprocessError: ffprobe command returned non-zero exit status

    **Note:** If parameter `ffprobe_cmd_override` receives a non-``None``
    argument, it must be a string that specifies the full file-path (either
    absolute or relative to the current directory) to an executable to call,
    to provide the functionality of the ``ffprobe`` command.

    The intention of parameter `ffprobe_cmd_override` is to enable client code
    to specify a particular executable to call, instead of searching ``$PATH``
    for the default ``ffprobe`` command.  Reasons for this might include:

    - Security: Specify a particular known/trusted executable to call,
      rather than relying upon whatever happens to be found first in ``$PATH``.
    - Control: Call a particular executable instead of what is installed in
      the system ``$PATH``.

    (This library defaults to searching for ``ffprobe`` in ``$PATH`` because:
    (a) it's the easiest way to get started using this library (rather than
    requiring a new library user to search for, and specify, the full file-path
    to the ``ffprobe`` command on their own system); and (b) searching for an
    executable in ``$PATH`` is what ``subprocess.Popen`` does *by default*.)

    Example usage of this function::

        import ffprobe3

        # Local media file
        ffprobe_output = ffprobe3.probe('media-file.mov')

        # or, Remote video stream
        ffprobe_output = ffprobe3.probe('http://some-streaming-url.com:8080/stream')

    :ivar subtitle: (list of :class:`FFsubtitleStream`) only parsed subtitle streams
    :ivar video: (list of :class:`FFvideoStream`) only parsed video streams

    In addition, the original ``dict`` instance of the parsed JSON output
    from ``ffprobe`` can always be accessed directly in the ``.parsed_json``
    attribute of base class :class:`ParsedJson`.
